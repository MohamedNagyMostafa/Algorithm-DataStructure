## Installation
To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website here.

## Usage
Each file in the repository represents a different algorithm or data structure. To run a specific algorithm, you can navigate to the relevant directory and run the corresponding file.

For example, if you want to run the binary search algorithm, you can navigate to `Algorithm-DataStructure/basic algorithms/binary search/` directory and run the `binary_search.py` file using the following command:

```python
python binary_search.py
```
You can modify the input data in the files as per your requirements.
